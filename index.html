							<h2 >Sam Macasieb is found unconscious on the ground</h2>
							<p>Some time between 3:00am and 3:30am, a worker at the West Oakland facility finds Macasieb lying motionless on the ground. The coworker yells to another coworker, who contacts his supervisor. At the same time, another employee hears the call and runs to her supervisor. That supervisor assess Macasieb and waits for a higher manager to arrive. Then, the postal police are contacted.</p>

							<h2>911 receives call</h2>
							<p>Following facility policy, the on-site Postal Police dial 911. Dispatch records confirm the call was at 3:53am. Because the Postal Police are dialing from a landline on a different floor from Macasieb, they have trouble relaying important information to the dispatchers, such as where Macasieb's injuries appear to be or whether his eyes were open or not.</p>
